## Usage

To present a popover in SwiftUI, use the `.popover(present:attributes:view)` modifier. By default, the popover uses the parent view as the source frame.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Popovers

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var present = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Present popover!") {
            present = true
        }
        .popover(present: $present) { /// here!
            Text("Hi, I'm a popover.")
                .padding()
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .background(.blue)
                .cornerRadius(16)
        }
    }
}
```

In UIKit, create a `Popover` instance, then present with `Popover.present(_:)`. You should also set the source frame.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Popovers

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var button: UIButton!
    @IBAction func buttonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
        var popover = Popover { PopoverView() }
        popover.attributes.sourceFrame = { [weak button] in
            button.windowFrame()
        }
        Popovers.present(popover) /// here!
    }
}

struct PopoverView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hi, I'm a popover.")
            .padding()
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .background(.blue)
            .cornerRadius(16)
    }
}
```

<br>

## Customization
Customize popovers through the `Attributes` struct. Pretty much everything is customizable, including positioning, animations, and dismissal behavior.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>
SwiftUI
</strong>
<br>
Configure in the <code>attributes</code> parameter.
</td>
<td>
<strong>
UIKit
</strong>
<br>
Modify the <code>attributes</code> property.
</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>
<br>

```swift
.popover(
    present: $present,
    attributes: {
        $0.position = .absolute(
            originAnchor: .bottom,
            popoverAnchor: .topLeft
        )
    }
) {
    Text("Hi, I'm a popover.")
}
```
</td>
<td>
<br>

```swift
var popover = Popover { Text("Hi, I'm a popover.") }
popover.attributes.position = .absolute(
    originAnchor: .bottom,
    popoverAnchor: .topLeft
)
Popovers.present(popover)
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### üè∑‚ÄÇTag ‚Ä¢ `String?`
Tag popovers to access them later from anywhere. This is useful for updating existing popovers.

```swift
/// Set the tag.
$0.tag = "Your Tag"

/// Access it later.
let popover = Popovers.popovers(tagged: "Your Tag")
```

Note: When you use the `.popover(selection:tag:attributes:view:)` modifier, this `tag` is automatically set to what you provide in the parameter.

### ‚èπ‚ÄÇPosition ‚Ä¢ `Position`
The popover's position can either be `.absolute` (attached to a view) or `.relative` (picture-in-picture). The enum's associated value additionally configures which sides and corners are used.

- `Anchor`s represent sides and corners.
- For `.absolute`, provide the origin anchor and popover anchor.
- For `.relative`, provide the popover anchors. If there's multiple, the user will be able to drag between them like a PIP.

Anchor Reference | `.absolute(originAnchor: .bottom, popoverAnchor: .topLeft)` | `.relative(popoverAnchors: [.right])`
--- | --- | ---
![](GitHub/Assets/Anchors.png) | ![](GitHub/Assets/Absolute.png) | ![](GitHub/Assets/Relative.png)

### ‚¨õÔ∏è‚ÄÇSource Frame ‚Ä¢ `(() -> CGRect)`
This is the frame that the popover attaches to or is placed within, depending on its position. This must be in global window coordinates. Because frames are can change so often, this property is a closure. Whenever the device rotates or some other bounds change happens, the closure will be called.


<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>
SwiftUI
</strong>
<br>
The source frame is automatically set to the parent view. You can still override it if you want.
</td>
<td>
<strong>
UIKit
</strong>
<br>
It's highly recommended to provide a source frame, otherwise the popover will appear in the top-left of the screen.
</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>
<br>

```swift
$0.sourceFrame = { /** some CGRect here */ }
```
</td>
<td>
<br>

```swift
 /// use `weak` to prevent a retain cycle
attributes.sourceFrame = { [weak button] in
    button.windowFrame()
}
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### üî≥‚ÄÇSource Frame Inset ‚Ä¢ `UIEdgeInsets`
Edge insets to apply to the source frame. Positive values inset the frame, negative values expand it.

Absolute | Relative
--- | ---
![Source view has padding around it, so the popover is offset down.](GitHub/Assets/SourceFrameInsetAbsolute.png) | ![Source view is inset, so the popover is brought more towards the center of the screen.](GitHub/Assets/SourceFrameInsetRelative.png)

### ‚è∫‚ÄÇScreen Edge Padding ‚Ä¢ `UIEdgeInsets`
Global insets for all popovers to prevent them from overflowing off the screen. Kind of like a safe area. Default value is `UIEdgeInsets(top: 16, left: 16, bottom: 16, right: 16)`.

### üü©‚ÄÇPresentation ‚Ä¢ `Presentation`
This property stores the animation and transition that's applied when the popover appears.

```swift
/// Default values:
$0.presentation.animation = .default
$0.presentation.transition = .opacity
```

### üü•‚ÄÇDismissal ‚Ä¢ `Dismissal`
This property stores the popover's dismissal behavior. There's a couple sub-properties here.

```swift
/// Same thing as `Presentation`.
$0.dismissal.animation = .default
$0.dismissal.transition = .opacity

/// Advanced stuff! Here's their default values:
$0.dismissal.mode = .tapOutside
$0.dismissal.tapOutsideIncludesOtherPopovers = false
$0.dismissal.excludedFrames = { [] }
$0.dismissal.dragMovesPopoverOffScreen = true
$0.dismissal.dragDismissalProximity = CGFloat(0.25)
```

**Mode:** Configure how the popover should auto-dismiss. You can have multiple at the same time!
- `.tapOutside` - dismiss the popover when the user taps outside it.
- `.dragDown` - dismiss the popover when the user drags it down.
- `.dragUp` - dismiss the popover when the user drags it up.
- `.none` - don't automatically dismiss the popover.

**Tap Outside Includes Other Popovers:** Only applies when `mode` is `.tapOutside`. If this is enabled, the popover will be dismissed when the user taps outside, **even when another presented popover is what's tapped**. Normally when you tap another popover that's presented, the current one will not dismiss.

**Excluded Frames:** Only applies when `mode` is `.tapOutside`. When the user taps outside the popover, but the tap lands on one of these frames, the popover will stay presented. If you want multiple popovers, you should set the source frames of your other popovers as the excluded frames.

```swift
/// Set one popover's source frame as the other's excluded frame.
/// This prevents the the current popover from being dismissed before animating to the other one.

let popover1 = Popover { Text("Hello") }
popover1.attributes.sourceFrame = { [weak button1] in button1.windowFrame() }
popover1.attributes.dismissal.excludedFrames = { [weak button2] in [ button2.windowFrame() ] }

let popover2 = Popover { Text("Hello") }
popover2.attributes.sourceFrame = { [weak button2] in button2.windowFrame() }
popover2.attributes.dismissal.excludedFrames = { [weak button1] in [ button1.windowFrame() ] }
```

**Drag Moves Popover Off Screen:** Only applies when `mode` is `.dragDown` or `.dragUp`. If this is enabled, the popover will continue moving off the screen after the user drags.

**Drag Dismissal Proximity:** Only applies when `mode` is `.dragDown` or `.dragUp`. Represents the point on the screen that the drag must reach in order to auto-dismiss. This property is multiplied by the screen's height.


<img src="GitHub/Assets/DragDismissalProximity.png" width=300 alt="Diagram with the top 25% of the screen highlighted in blue.">


### üîÄ‚ÄÇRubber Banding Mode ‚Ä¢ `RubberBandingMode`
Configures which axes the popover can "rubber-band" on when dragged. The default is `[.xAxis, .yAxis]`.

- `.xAxis` - enable rubber banding on the x-axis.
- `.yAxis` - enable rubber banding on the y-axis.
- `.none` - disable rubber banding.

### üõë‚ÄÇBlocks Background Touches ‚Ä¢ `Bool`
Set this to true to prevent underlying views from being pressed.

<img src="GitHub/Assets/BlocksBackgroundTouches.png" width=300 alt="Popover overlaid over some buttons. Tapping on the buttons has no effect.">

### üëâ‚ÄÇOn Tap Outside ‚Ä¢ `(() -> Void)?`
A closure that's called whenever the user taps outside the popover.

### üéà‚ÄÇOn Dismiss ‚Ä¢ `(() -> Void)?`
A closure that's called when the popover is dismissed.

### üî∞‚ÄÇOn Context Change ‚Ä¢ `((Context) -> Void)?`
A closure that's called whenever the context changed. The context contains the popover's attributes, current frame, and other visible traits.

<br>

## Utilities
Popovers comes with some features to make your life easier.

### ‚ú®‚ÄÇAnimating Between Popovers
As long as the view structure is the same, you can smoothly transition from one popover to another.

    var newPopover = Popover { Text("Hi, I'm a popover.").background(.blue) }
    newPopover.attributes.sourceFrame = { [weak button1] in button1.windowFrame() }
    newPopover.attributes.dismissal.excludedFrames = { [weak button2] in [button2.windowFrame()] }
    newPopover.attributes.tag = "Popover 1"
    
    if let oldPopover = Popovers.popover(tagged: "Popover 2") {
        Popovers.replace(oldPopover, with: newPopover)

    }
}
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

| --- |

### üåÉ‚ÄÇBackground
You can put anything in a popover's background.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>
SwiftUI
</strong>
<br>
Use the <code>.popover(present:attributes:view:background:)</code> modifier. 
</td>
<td>
<strong>
UIKit
</strong>
<br>
Use the <code>Popover(attributes:view:background:)</code> initializer. 
</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>
<br>

```swift
.popover(present: $present) {
    PopoverView()
} background: { /// here!
    Color.green.opacity(0.5)
}
```
</td>
<td>
<br>

```swift
var popover = Popover {
    PopoverView()
} background: { /// here!
    Color.green.opacity(0.5)
}
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<img src="GitHub/Assets/PopoverBackground.png" width=200 alt="Green background over the entire screen, but underneath the popover">


### üìñ‚ÄÇPopover Reader
Reads the popover's context, which includes its frame. It's kind of like [`GeometryReader`](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-provide-relative-sizes-using-geometryreader), but cooler. You can put it in the popover's view or background.

```swift
.popover(present: $present) {
    PopoverView()
} background: {
    PopoverReader { context in
        Path {
            $0.move(to: context.frame.point(at: .bottom))
            $0.addLine(to: Popovers.windowBounds.point(at: .bottom))
        }
        .stroke(Color.blue, lineWidth: 4)
    }
}
```

| <img src="GitHub/Assets/PopoverReader.gif" width=200 alt="Line connects the bottom of the popover with the bottom of the screen"> |
| --- |

### üîñ‚ÄÇFrame Tags
Lets you tag view frames in SwiftUI. You can use this to provide a popover's `sourceFrame` or `excludedFrames`. As convenient as it is, don't use it for anything else, due to possible State issues.

```swift
Text("This is a view")
    .frameTag("Your Tag Name")

/// ...

.popover(
    present: $present,
    attributes: {
        $0.sourceFrame = Popovers.frameTagged("Your Tag Name")
    }
)
```

### üìÑ‚ÄÇTemplates
Get started quickly with some templates. All of them are inside [`PopoverTemplates.swift`](Source/PopoverTemplates.swift) with example usage in the example app.
- `AlertButtonStyle` - a button style resembling a system alert.
- `VisualEffectView` - lets you use UIKit blurs in SwiftUI.
- `ContainerShadow` - a view modifier that applies a system-like shadow.
- `Container` - a wrapper view for the `BackgroundWithArrow` shape.
- `BackgroundWithArrow` - a shape with an arrow that looks like the system popover.
- `CurveConnector` - an animatable shape with endpoints that you can set.
- `Menu` - the system menu but built from scratch.
- `MenuButton` - buttons to put in the `Menu`.

<br>

## Notes
### State Re-Rendering
If you directly pass a variable down to the popover's view, it might not update. Instead, move the view into its own struct and pass down a `Binding`.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>
Yes
</strong>
<br>
The popover's view is in a separate struct, with <code>$string</code> passed down.
</td>
<td>
<strong>
No
</strong>
<br>
The button is directly inside the <code>view</code> parameter and receives <code>string</code>.
</td>
</tr>
  
<tr>
<td>
<br>

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var present = false
    @State var string = "Hello, I'm a popover."

    var body: some View {
        Button("Present popover!") { present = true }
        .popover(present: $present) {
            PopoverView(string: $string) /// Pass down a Binding ($).
        }
    }
}

/// Create a separate view to ensure that the button updates.
struct PopoverView: View {
    @Binding var string: String

    var body: some View {
        Button(string) { string = "The string changed." }
        .background(.mint)
        .cornerRadius(16)
    }
}
```
</td>
<td>
<br>

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var present = false
    @State var string = "Hello, I'm a popover."

    var body: some View {
        Button("Present popover!") {
            present = true
        }
        .popover(present: $present) {

            /// Directly passing down the variable (no $) is unsupported. The button might not update.
            Button(string) { 
                string = "The string changed."
            }
            .background(.mint)
            .cornerRadius(16)
        }
    }
}
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Popover Hierarchy
To bring a popover to front, just attach [`.zIndex(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/zindex(_:)). A higher index will bring it forwards.

### Popover Not Animating At First?
Make sure that `Popovers` is set up by calling `Popovers.prepare()` when your app starts.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Popovers

@main
struct YourApp: App {
    @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .onChange(of: scenePhase) { _ in
            Popovers.prepare() /// Make sure Popovers is ready.
        }
    }
}
```
